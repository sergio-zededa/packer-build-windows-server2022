# Windows Server 2022 Packer Template

This folder contains a legacy JSON Packer template that builds a Windows Server 2022 qcow2 image using QEMU/KVM and WinRM.

## What it builds

- QEMU/KVM VM named "windows-server-2022"
- Output image in `build/os-base/` as qcow2
- WinRM communicator with user `packer` and password `PackerPassw0rd!`
- VirtIO drivers are downloaded and installed during provisioning
- Cloudbase-Init is installed and Sysprep is run

## Prerequisites

- Packer installed (JSON templates still supported)
- QEMU/KVM installed and working
- Enough disk space for a ~20 GB image
- The Windows Server 2022 ISO copied into this directory

## Install Packer (Linux)

Requirements:

- `curl`, `gpg`, `unzip`, and `sudo`

Ubuntu/Debian (HashiCorp APT repo):

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y curl gpg unzip
curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y packer
```

Verify:

```bash
packer version
```


## Required files

Place these files in this directory (the same directory as the JSON template):

- `SERVER_EVAL_x64FRE_en-us.iso`
- `Scripts/CloudBase-init-Install.ps1`
- `Scripts/prep-sysprep.ps1`
- `Scripts/mount_PV_disk.ps1`
- `Scripts/cloudbase-init-conf`
- `floppy/Autounattend.xml`

The template uses the current working directory via `{{env `PWD`}}` to locate these files, so run Packer from this directory.

## Usage

From this directory:

```bash
packer build winserver2k22_build.json
```

If you need to override the working directory, you can set it for a single command:

```bash
PWD=/path/to/packer-windows-builder packer build winserver2k22_build.json
```

## Notes

- WinRM runs over HTTP on port 5985 during the build.
- The template binds VNC to 0.0.0.0; adjust if you need to limit access.
- The VirtIO ISO is downloaded each run from `http://192.168.1.9:8080/drivers/virtio-win.iso`.
- The build uses an 18 GB qcow2 disk (Packer `disk_size` is 18432 MB).

## Additional disk auto-mount

- The build copies `Scripts/mount_PV_disk.ps1` into Cloudbase-Init LocalScripts so it runs automatically on first boot.
- The script checks for additional disks and handles them as follows:
	- If a disk is offline, it attempts to clear read-only state and bring it online.
	- If a disk is RAW (no filesystem), it initializes GPT, creates a partition, formats NTFS, and assigns drive letter `Z:`.
	- If a volume already has a filesystem but no drive letter, it assigns drive letter `Z:`.
- Script log file in the guest:
	- `C:\Program Files\Cloudbase Solutions\Cloudbase-Init\LocalScripts\init_extra_disks.log`

## Output

After a successful build, the qcow2 image is in `build/os-base/`.

The post-processor creates a compressed qcow2 at `build/os-base/windows-server-2022_compressed.qcow2` and removes the original uncompressed file.
